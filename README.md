# Unity Games Collection

This repository contains WebGL builds of my Unity projects, showcasing different game prototypes and mechanics.

## Included Games

### Roboman  
A Flappy Bird–inspired arcade game where players control Roboman through increasingly difficult obstacles. The game offers three difficulty levels and culminates in a boss fight, adding depth and excitement to the classic formula.

### Paper Mario  
A 2.5D platformer inspired by *Paper Mario 64*, built as a 3D Unity project. Explore handcrafted environments and engage in simple turn-based battles with Goombas in this nostalgic tribute to Mario's papery adventures.
